A **Knowledge Graph** is a structured representation of knowledge that captures real-world entities, their relationships, and attributes in a machine-readable format. It organizes information as a **graph**, where:

- **Nodes (or vertices)** represent entities such as people, places, organizations, events, or concepts.
- **Edges (or links)** represent the relationships between these entities (e.g., "born in", "works at", "located in").

For example, in a knowledge graph:

- Nodes: _Albert Einstein_, _Germany_, _Physicist_
- Edges: _Albert Einstein → born in → Germany_, _Albert Einstein → profession → Physicist_

### Key Features:

1. **Semantic Understanding**: It encodes meaning (semantics) so machines can understand and reason about data.
2. **Interconnected Data**: Entities are linked through meaningful relationships, enabling rich context.
3. **Heterogeneous Integration**: Combines data from multiple sources into a unified structure.
4. **Queryable and Expandable**: Supports complex queries and can be updated with new facts.

### Applications:

- **Search Engines**: Google uses its Knowledge Graph to enhance search results with direct answers and summaries.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Helps recommend related content by understanding user interests and item relationships.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Powers chatbots and virtual assistants by providing contextual knowledge.
- **Enterprise Data Management**: Integrates siloed data across departments for better insights.

### Examples:

- **Google Knowledge Graph**
- **Wikidata**
- **DBpedia** (extracted from Wikipedia)
- **Amazon Product Graph**

In essence, a Knowledge Graph turns fragmented data into a web of meaningful, interconnected knowledge, enabling smarter applications and deeper insights.
