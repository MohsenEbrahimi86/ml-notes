LSTM stands for **Long Short-Term Memory**. It is a type of **recurrent neural network (RNN)** architecture specifically designed to address the limitations of traditional RNNs, particularly the **vanishing gradient problem**, which makes it difficult for standard RNNs to learn long-range dependencies in sequential data.

### Key Features of LSTM:
1. **Memory Cell**:  
   LSTMs have a special structure called a *cell state* that acts like a conveyor belt, allowing information to flow unchanged across many time steps. This helps preserve long-term information.

2. **Gating Mechanisms**:  
   LSTMs use three main gates to regulate the flow of information:
   - **Forget Gate**: Decides what information to discard from the cell state.
   - **Input Gate**: Updates the cell state with new information.
   - **Output Gate**: Determines what part of the cell state to output.

   These gates are implemented using sigmoid and tanh activation functions and are learned during training.

3. **Handles Long-Term Dependencies**:  
   By selectively remembering or forgetting information over long sequences, LSTMs can effectively model patterns that span many time steps—something standard RNNs struggle with.

### Common Applications:
- Time series forecasting (e.g., stock prices, weather)
- Natural language processing (e.g., machine translation, text generation)
- Speech recognition
- Handwriting recognition
- Anomaly detection in sequences

### Example:
In language modeling, an LSTM can remember that a sentence started with “The cat…” and later use that context to choose appropriate words like “meowed” instead of “barked,” even if many words appear in between.

### Variants:
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: A simpler alternative to LSTM with fewer gates.
- **Bidirectional LSTM**: Processes data in both forward and backward directions for richer context.

In summary, **LSTM is a powerful neural network architecture for modeling sequential data**, especially when long-range dependencies are important.
