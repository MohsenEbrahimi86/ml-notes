**Autoregressive Models (AR models)** are a class of statistical and machine learning models used to predict future values in a time series based on its own past values. The term “autoregressive” means that the model regresses (i.e., predicts) a variable against itself — specifically, against its own previous (lagged) values.

---

### **Core Idea**

An autoregressive model assumes that the current value of a time series is a linear combination of its previous values plus a random error term.

For example, an AR(p) model uses the _p_ most recent past values to predict the current value:

\[
X*t = c + \phi_1 X*{t-1} + \phi*2 X*{t-2} + \dots + \phi*p X*{t-p} + \varepsilon_t
\]

Where:

- \( X_t \) = value of the series at time \( t \)
- \( c \) = constant (intercept)
- \( \phi_1, \phi_2, ..., \phi_p \) = model parameters (coefficients)
- \( X*{t-1}, X*{t-2}, ..., X\_{t-p} \) = previous \( p \) values (lags)
- \( \varepsilon_t \) = white noise error term (random, uncorrelated with mean 0)

The parameter \( p \) is called the **order** of the AR model.

### **Example: AR(1) Model**

\[
X*t = c + \phi_1 X*{t-1} + \varepsilon_t
\]
This means today’s value depends linearly on yesterday’s value.

If \( \phi*1 = 0.8 \) and \( c = 0 \), then:
\[
X_t = 0.8 \cdot X*{t-1} + \varepsilon_t
\]
So if yesterday’s value was 10, today’s expected value is 8, plus some random noise.

---

### **Key Properties**

- **Stationarity**: AR models typically assume the time series is stationary (mean, variance, and autocorrelation don’t change over time).
- **Linear Dependencies**: Captures linear relationships between past and present.
- **Memory**: The model has “memory” of the last \( p \) observations.
- **Invertibility**: Related to the ability to represent the model as an infinite moving average (MA) process.

---

### **Applications**

- Forecasting stock prices, weather, electricity demand
- Econometrics (e.g., GDP growth prediction)
- Signal processing
- Speech synthesis (e.g., in audio generation models)

---

### **Extensions & Related Models**

- **AR(p)**: Autoregressive of order p
- **ARMA(p,q)**: Combines AR(p) and Moving Average (MA(q)) components
- **ARIMA(p,d,q)**: Adds differencing (I = integrated) to handle non-stationary data
- **VAR(p)**: Vector Autoregression — for multiple interrelated time series
- **Deep Learning**: Modern variants like WaveNet or GPT use _autoregressive_ principles for sequence generation (predicting next token based on previous ones)

---

### **Important Note: Autoregressive ≠ Causation**

Just because a model uses past values to predict the future doesn't mean those past values _cause_ the future value — it only reflects statistical dependence.

---

### **Visualization Analogy**

Imagine you're trying to guess tomorrow’s temperature. An AR(3) model would say:

> “Tomorrow’s temp = 0.5 × today’s temp + 0.3 × yesterday’s temp + 0.1 × day-before-yesterday’s temp + random noise.”

It’s like using your memory of the last few days to guess what’s coming next.

In summary, **autoregressive models are foundational tools in time series analysis**, leveraging historical patterns to forecast future outcomes — simple yet powerful, especially when combined with other techniques.
