**Multi-tier retrieval** refers to a search or information retrieval strategy that involves **multiple stages or layers of filtering and ranking** to progressively refine and improve the relevance, efficiency, and quality of retrieved results. It’s commonly used in large-scale search systems (like web search engines, recommendation systems, or enterprise search) where speed, scalability, and precision are critical.

### Why Use Multi-Tier Retrieval?

In large datasets (e.g., billions of documents), it’s computationally expensive to apply complex ranking models to every item. Multi-tier retrieval solves this by:

1. **Quickly narrowing down** candidates using fast, lightweight methods.
2. **Refining results** in subsequent stages with more computationally intensive but accurate models.

### Typical Tiers in Multi-Tier Retrieval

1. **Tier 1: Candidate Generation (Recall-Oriented)**

   - Goal: Retrieve a broad but manageable set of potentially relevant items.
   - Methods: Inverted index lookups, term matching, simple Boolean queries, or approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search for embeddings.
   - Fast and scalable — may return thousands of candidates.

2. **Tier 2: Re-Ranking (Precision-Oriented)**

   - Goal: Re-rank the top candidates from Tier 1 using more sophisticated models.
   - Methods: Machine learning models (e.g., Learning to Rank, BERT-based models, neural rankers).
   - Slower but more accurate — operates on hundreds or thousands of items.

3. **Tier 3 (Optional): Final Filtering or Personalization**
   - Apply business rules, diversity constraints, personalization, or real-time signals.
   - May involve user context, session history, or A/B testing logic.

### Example: Web Search Engine

- **Tier 1**: Use inverted index to find all documents containing query keywords → returns 10,000 docs.
- **Tier 2**: Apply BM25 + lightweight ML model to rank top 1,000.
- **Tier 3**: Use BERT or transformer-based model to re-rank top 100 → return top 10 to user.

### Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Avoids running expensive models on the entire corpus.
- **Scalability**: Handles massive datasets in real-time.
- **Flexibility**: Each tier can be independently optimized or updated.
- **Improved Relevance**: Combines broad recall with precise ranking.

### Related Concepts

- **Two-stage retrieval**: A simpler form of multi-tier (e.g., retrieve-then-rerank).
- **Cascade ranking**: Similar idea — progressively filter/rank with increasing cost and accuracy.
- **Hybrid search**: May combine keyword + vector search in early tiers.

### In Summary

> **Multi-tier retrieval is a layered approach to search: start broad and fast, then get smarter and slower on smaller candidate sets — balancing speed, scale, and accuracy.**

This architecture is foundational in modern search engines, e-commerce platforms, and AI-powered recommendation systems.
